            <b>Lionel Messi:</b> Lionel Messi was born
            24 June 1987(age 35 years) in Rosario, Santa Fe, 
            Argentina also known as Leo Messi, 
            is an Argentine professional footballer who plays 
            as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain 
            and captains the Argentina national team. Widely 
            regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, 
            Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards, 
            a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was 
            named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving 
            the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional 
            career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, 
            including 10 La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and 
            four UEFA Champions Leagues. With his country, he won the 
            2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific 
            goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records 
            for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) 
            and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192) 
            and the Copa América (17). He has also the most international 
            goals by a South American male (98). Messi has scored over 790 
            senior career goals for club and country, and has the 
            most goals by a player for a single club (672).
